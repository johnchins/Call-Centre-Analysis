### Data and Method
**Data:** Call Centre dataset consisting of 12 columns and 32,942 rows

**Tools:** PowerBI



### Questions Asked wrt to the Analysis

1. **Call Volume Trends:** Why are call volumes higher on Thursdays and Fridays compared to other days of the week?
   
2. **Geographic Distribution:** What factors contribute to California and Florida receiving the highest number of calls compared to other states?
   
3. **Reason for Calls:** Why do billing questions (23.5K) dominate the reasons for calls, and how can this issue be reduced through proactive communication?
   
4. **Channel Preference:** What drives the preference for call-center interactions (32.3%) over other channels like chatbots, email, or web?
   
5. **Performance Gaps:** With response time at 75%, what steps are needed to reach closer to 100% efficiency?
    
6. **Customer Sentiment:** Why are negative (11.1K) and very negative (6K) sentiments so high compared to positive (3.9K) and very positive (3.2K)?
    
7. **Channel vs. Sentiment:** Is there a correlation between the channel used (e.g., chatbot, email) and the resulting customer sentiment?
    
8. **Operational Focus:** Based on the data, should the call centre focus more on training staff for billing-related queries or improving digital channels to reduce call-centre dependency?



### Possible Answers

1. Calls are higher on Thursdays and Fridays compared to other days of the week because its possible that Customers may wait until later in the week to resolve issues after attempting self-service earlier. Billing cycles or service updates might also trigger higher calls mid- to end-week.

2. California and Florida are receiving the highest number of calls because both states have large populations and possibly more subscribers/customers, naturally leading to higher call volumes. Local promotions or recurring service issues may also play a role.

3. Billing questions dominate the reasons for calls because Billing is a recurring, complex area where errors or misunderstandings are common. Customers may struggle with invoices, charges, or unclear payment methods.

4. Customers may prefer Call-Centre interaction as they may feel issues are resolved faster when speaking directly to a person. Chatbots and email may lack responsiveness or the ability to resolve complex problems.

5. Staffing adjustments, improved training, and expansion of digital channels could improve response time from 75% to 100% efficiency. Also, automating repetitive queries (e.g., billing FAQs) would reduce load on agents.

6. Long call times (25 minutes average) and unresolved billing/service issues contribute to frustration. Customers usually call only when problems escalate, skewing sentiment toward negative. This may be the reason why negative and very negative sentiments are so high compared to positive ones

7. Channels used may influence sentimenent because Customers using chatbots or email may feel dissatisfied due to slow or unhelpful responses, pushing them to escalate to the call center with heightened frustration, driving negative sentiment.

8. Both training staff for billing-related queries and improving digital channels are necessary, but prioritizing billing training is critical given its overwhelming share of calls. At the same time, strengthening digital self-service could reduce overall call volume in the long run.
